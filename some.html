     <p> <div style="color : #0DBBF7";><center>My name is <u><i><b>Nada Benabla</b></i></u>. I'm 18 years old and from <i>Casablanca</i>. I recently graduated from high school and got my baccalaureate this year.
 <br>I'm really interested in astronomy and cosmology, which I believe is one of the reasons that brought me to this camp. 
<br>Knowing that almost everything in this field is related to computer science makes me even more excited about being here.</br>
     My experience at e-nitiate has been amazing so far. The classes are very interesting </div></center></br></p>
