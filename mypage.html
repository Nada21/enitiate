     <h1>Nada Benabla</h1>

     <p> My name is <u><i>Nada BENABLA</i></u>. I'm 18 years old and from <i>Casablanca</i>. I recently graduated from high school and got my baccalaureate this year. I'm really interested in astronomy and cosmology, which I believe is one of the reasons that brought me to this camp. Knowing that almost everything in this field is related to computer science makes me even more excited about being here.
     My experience at e-nitiate has been amazing so far, even though we've been here for only two days. We managed to learn a lot of good stuff.</p>
